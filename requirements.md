Certainly! Here's a full midterm test based on the problem of optimizing delivery routes using **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** for dynamic, real-time scenarios like deliveries where traffic and road conditions change frequently. The test is split into **3 tasks** as requested, each progressively building on the previous one to test different skills and knowledge.

### **Midterm Test: Optimizing Delivery Routes using DQN**

#### **Background:**
The problem at hand is the **Route Optimization Problem**, which integrates the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** with real-world map data, specifically using **Google Maps API**. The goal is to optimize the delivery routes considering real-time dynamic factors like traffic conditions, road closures, and detours.

You are required to use a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** to solve the problem in a dynamic and real-time scenario, where the route needs to be adjusted based on constantly changing traffic data.

### **Task 1: Problem Formulation and DQN Setup (30 points)**

**Objective:** 
In this task, you will define the problem of optimizing delivery routes using the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) framework and integrate it with a Deep Q-Network (DQN). The goal is to create a suitable representation of the problem and the environment for a DQN agent.

#### **Requirements:**
1. **Problem Formulation:**
   - Define the **state space**: What information does the agent need to know at each step (e.g., current location, visited cities, traffic data)?
   - Define the **action space**: What are the possible actions the agent can take (e.g., choose next city to visit)?
   - Define the **reward function**: What rewards or penalties should the agent receive for taking an action (e.g., a reward for visiting a new city, penalty for taking a longer route)?
   - Define the **termination conditions**: When does the problem end (e.g., when all cities are visited, when the delivery is complete)?

2. **DQN Setup:**
   - Explain how the DQN can be used to solve the problem. What is the role of the neural network in learning the optimal route?
   - Implement the **environment class** where the state space, action space, and reward function are clearly defined.
   - Provide a basic implementation of a **DQN agent** with the following components:
     - A neural network architecture.
     - Experience replay buffer.
     - Epsilon-greedy policy.

### **Task 2: Implementing DQN for Route Optimization (40 points)**

**Objective:** 
In this task, you will implement and train the DQN agent to navigate the delivery route in a static environment (initial conditions, no real-time updates) using **Google Maps API** to compute travel times and distances.

#### **Requirements:**
1. **Training the DQN Agent:**
   - Implement the **Q-learning update rule** in the context of DQN, using the neural network to approximate the Q-values for state-action pairs.
   - Implement **experience replay** to store and sample past experiences (state, action, reward, next state).
   - Use the **epsilon-greedy policy** during training to balance exploration and exploitation.

2. **Environment Interaction:**
   - Use the **Google Maps API** to calculate travel times and distances between cities.
   - Simulate the agent moving between cities based on its actions and updating the state at each step.
   - Track the agent’s performance in terms of total distance or time taken to complete the route.

3. **Training the Model:**
   - Train the DQN agent for a fixed number of episodes. During each episode, the agent should attempt to visit all cities starting and ending at the same location.
   - **Plot the learning curve**: Track the cumulative reward or loss over episodes to visualize the agent’s improvement over time.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - After training, evaluate the agent's performance by letting it navigate a new set of cities and calculate the total travel time or distance.

### **Task 3: Real-Time Dynamic Updates with Traffic Conditions (30 points)**

**Objective:** 
In this task, you will extend the DQN agent to handle **dynamic, real-time traffic updates**. This simulates a more realistic delivery scenario, where traffic conditions change frequently and the route needs to be adjusted.

#### **Requirements:**
1. **Dynamic Traffic Updates:**
   - Integrate **real-time traffic data** from the Google Maps API into the environment. The travel time between cities should change dynamically based on traffic conditions (e.g., delays due to traffic, road closures).
   - Simulate how the agent re-routes when new traffic data is received, adjusting its route accordingly.

2. **Real-Time Route Adjustment:**
   - Implement **dynamic re-routing**: At every decision step, the agent should evaluate the updated traffic information and adjust its route to minimize the new travel time or distance.
   - Use the updated travel times from the Google Maps API to calculate the agent’s new optimal path.
   
3. **Policy Update for Dynamic Conditions:**
   - Adapt the **DQN update** process to accommodate dynamic re-routing. Ensure that the agent continues learning from new traffic conditions and adapts its behavior accordingly.
   - Monitor how the agent’s behavior changes when it encounters real-time traffic updates (e.g., rerouting in response to heavy traffic).

4. **Evaluation and Analysis:**
   - Evaluate the agent's ability to handle dynamic, real-time traffic conditions by testing it on a set of cities with varying traffic conditions.
   - **Compare the performance** of the agent with and without real-time traffic updates. How much improvement does the agent show in minimizing travel time or distance with the dynamic updates?
